# Classification-of-Arrhythmia
Classification of Arrhythmia
❤️ Arrhythmia Classification Using Machine Learning
This project aims to classify arrhythmia using machine learning algorithms, with a focus on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. It includes two variations of the approach:

General Classification without any preprocessing.

Oversampled and PCA Classification to handle class imbalance and reduce dimensionality.

🌟 Project Overview
Arrhythmia Classification is a machine learning-based system that analyzes electrocardiogram (ECG) data to detect and classify heart arrhythmias. The dataset contains ECG features for patients, and we utilize techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and oversampling (SMOTE) to handle class imbalance.

🚀 Features
🧠 Machine Learning Classifiers: Utilizes various models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks for classification.

🔧 Dimensionality Reduction: PCA is applied to reduce the number of features and improve model performance.

⚖️ Handling Class Imbalance: SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is used to address class imbalance and enhance the model's ability to predict underrepresented classes.

🔬 Evaluation Metrics: The models are evaluated using standard metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.

💡 How It Works
1. General Classification and PCA (general_and_pca.ipynb):
The dataset is first loaded and cleaned for any missing values.

PCA is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, making the features more manageable.

Various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM) are applied to classify the arrhythmia types.

The performance is evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.

2. Oversampling and PCA Classification (oversampled_and_pca.ipynb):
The dataset is first balanced using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to generate synthetic examples for minority classes.

PCA is again applied after balancing the dataset.

Multiple classification models are trained and evaluated to handle the imbalance more effectively.

📊 Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total instances.

Precision: The proportion of positive predictions that are actually correct.

Recall: The proportion of actual positive instances that are correctly identified.

F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

ROC-AUC: Measures the performance of the classification model at various thresholds.
